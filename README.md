# Analyze-Death-Age-Difference-of-Right-Handers-with-Left-Handers
Barack Obama is left-handed. So are Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey; so were Babe Ruth and Marie Curie. A 1991 study reported that left-handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people. Nine years! Could this really be true?

In this project, we will explore this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. 

This notebook uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyse the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.

This project gives an opportunity of applying the skills from pandas Foundations, Statistical Thinking in Python, Introduction to Data Visualization with Python and concepts from Foundations of Probability in R and Fundamentals of Bayesian Data Analysis in R, including reading data, creating new columns, creating matplotlib visualizations, using NumPy arrays, constructing probabilities from frequency data, and Bayes' theorem.
